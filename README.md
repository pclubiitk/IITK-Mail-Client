Welcome to our Project in which we have developed a Mail Client Service using flutter and dart for backend.
This is a simple app which allows you to send and recieve mails using smtp and imap services.
We have used enough mail package to implement these functionalities.

There are three major features we have implemented up till now-

1. Authentication
2. Sending Mails
3. Fetching Mails
